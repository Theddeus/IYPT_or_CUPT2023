This is the numerical simulation of the motion of Euler's Pendulum. The Equations of motion is based on  R.I.Leine: Experimental and theoretical investigation of the energy 
dissipation of a rolling disk during its final stage of motion, 2008. The Magenitic field of the neodymium magnet is seen as a single loop current and the magnetic force experienced
by the magnetic rod is calculated as the integral of forces experienced by magnetic charges on top and bottom of it.
