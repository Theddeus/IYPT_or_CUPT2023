This directory contains a numerical model of Euler's pendulum. The equations of
motion follow R. I. Leine, *Experimental and theoretical investigation of the
energy dissipation of a rolling disk during its final stage of motion* (2008).
The magnetic field of the neodymium magnet is approximated as a single loop
current, and the magnetic force on the rod is obtained by integrating the forces
acting on its magnetic poles.
