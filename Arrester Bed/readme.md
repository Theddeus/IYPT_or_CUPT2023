# Arrester Bed

Simulation code for a cylinder travelling through a sand arrester bed.
`numerical.py` implements the Wongâ€“Reece model. Execute the file with

```bash
python numerical.py
```

to print the default drawbar force and torque. The functions `balance()` and
`friction()` can also be imported into your own scripts or notebooks for custom
calculations.
